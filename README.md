# 🌊 Flood Damage Regression Prediction 📊

This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to predicting flood damage using advanced regression techniques. The project encompasses crucial steps from raw data processing to sophisticated model training and insightful performance visualization.

## 🚀 Project Structure

* `FLOOD_REGRESSION_DAMAGE (3).ipynb`: 🧠 The core Jupyter Notebook that orchestrates data loading, comprehensive preprocessing, model definition, rigorous training, thorough evaluation, and dynamic visualization.
* `flood_dataset_regression.csv`: 💾 The foundational input dataset utilized for both training and testing our regression model. (Please ensure this file is added to your repository!)
* `flood_damage_prediction.csv`: ✨ (Optional) This file will be generated automatically upon successful execution of the notebook, containing the predicted flood damage values.

## ✨ Features

* **Data Loading & Exploration:** 🔍 Efficiently loads and performs initial exploratory analysis of the dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** 🧹 Implements essential steps like handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
* **Model Implementation:** 🧠 Integrates a powerful regression model, potentially a neural network built with PyTorch, designed to capture complex patterns within the data.
* **Training & Evaluation:** 📈 Executes the model training cycle and evaluates its performance rigorously using appropriate metrics.
* **Performance Visualization:** 📉 Generates intuitive plots to visualize training and testing loss over epochs, providing insights into model convergence and overfitting.
* **Classification Report:** 📋 While primarily a regression task, the notebook outputs a classification report, suggesting potential for classification analysis or a multi-task approach within the project. (This might indicate a component for classifying damage levels or comparing performance across different types of predictions).

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. The following essential libraries are required:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `torch`
* `scikit-learn`
* `xgboost`

### Installation

Follow these simple steps to get your environment ready:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/Flood-Damage-Regression.git](https://github.com/your_username/Flood-Damage-Regression.git)
    cd Flood-Damage-Regression
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

Once set up, you can run the project:

1.  **Place your dataset:** Ensure your `flood_dataset_regression.csv` file is located in the root directory of your cloned repository.
2.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "FLOOD_REGRESSION_DAMAGE (3).ipynb"
    ```
3.  **Execute all cells:** Run all cells within the notebook to perform the data analysis, model training, and generate results.

## 📊 Data

The core of this project relies on the `flood_dataset_regression.csv`. This dataset is rich with features pertinent to flood events and their associated impacts. The notebook provides detailed `dataframe.info()` outputs and displays the dataframe head, offering a clear understanding of its structure and content.

## 💡 Model

The notebook primarily focuses on a regression model, evidenced by the use of `torch` for a neural network and the plotting of training/testing loss. Interestingly, an `XGBClassifier` is also referenced in the notebook's outputs, which could imply a comparative analysis with an XGBoost model or a supplementary classification task.

## 📈 Results

The key results include:

* **Loss Visualization:** Plots illustrating the training and testing loss trends across epochs, vital for assessing model learning.
* **Classification Report:** A comprehensive report detailing precision, recall, f1-score, and support. This provides a multi-faceted view of the model's performance, particularly if there's a classification component to the flood damage prediction.
